# nora

A Dota 2 bot.

This version of the code creates a lobby, waits for a player to join, selects Nature's Prophet, and
makes a move towards the fountain. Past incarnations of this project have been used to make a
spectactor site similar to TrackDOTA with real time updates. There's a few critical pieces I've
decided not to share and it wont work without fixes. The rest of the code is probably mostly
working, I haven't touched it in a while. Sorry for the dragons.

This project stands on the shoulders of [SteamKit](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit) among other
libraries.
